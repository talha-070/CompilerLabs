# Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Analyzer for LPP.

The purpose of this repository is to share how to create a lexical analyzer, a syntactic analyzer, and therefore, a semantic analyzer, all of this with a brand new programming language. All analyzers were developed for a brand new programming language called LPP (standing for Pseudocode Programming Language).
